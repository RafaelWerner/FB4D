# FB4D â€“ The OpenSource Cross-Platform Library for _Firebase_

The _Google Firebase Cloud Database_ is used in many mobile and web applications worldwide and there are well-documented libraries for many languages and platforms. For Delphi, the cross-platform library **FB4D** supports the _Firebase Realtime Database_, the _Firestore Database_, the _Firebase Storage_ (for file storage), and _Firebase Functions_ (for calling server functions). For authentication, **FB4D** currently supports email/password authentication and anonymous login. 

The library builds on the _Firebase REST-API_ and provides all functionality with synchronous and asynchronous methods for the usage within GUI application, services and background threads. Both frameworks _VCL_ and _Firemonkey_ are supported. The library is a pure source code library and relies on class interfaces. For clean and short application code it supports fluent interface design.

### Wiki

This project offers a [wiki](https://github.com/SchneiderInfosystems/FB4D/wiki). Four example applications and a [Getting-Started](https://github.com/SchneiderInfosystems/FB4D/wiki/Getting-Started-with-FB4D) on the wiki will help you to start working with the library. For more detailed questions, the [interface reference](https://github.com/SchneiderInfosystems/FB4D/wiki/FB4D-Interface-Reference) will provide the answers you need.

You can find more learning videos on the following [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3qSIUzdGqoZA8hcA31X0Og).

### Prerequisites

This library requires at least Delphi 10 Seattle. The sample projects are developed with Delphi 10.3 Rio Update 3 and are ready for Delphi 10.4 Sydney.

#### Hint: Delphi 10.3 Update 1 is not longer supported because of an issue in the RTL. 

#### Hint: The project _FB4D_samples_VCL_ cannot be compiled with Delphi 10.1 Berlin and Seattle because of missing TCardPanel. 
The underlying FraSelfRegistration is not affected by this and can be used from Delphi 10 Seattle.  

Delphi is a registered trademark of [Embarcadero Technologies, Inc](https://www.embarcadero.com/de/products/delphi).

### Supported Platforms

**FB4D** is developed in pure object pascal and can be used with _Firemonkey_ on all supported plattforms. The library and its sample projects are currently tested with Win64/Win32, Mac64/32, Linux64 by using FMXLinux, iOS64 and Android. (Hint to mobile platforms: The TokenJWT to perform the token verifcation requires the installation of the OpenSSL libraries). For more information about using OpenSSL see the [installation of OpenSSL](https://github.com/SchneiderInfosystems/FB4D/wiki/Getting-Started-with-FB4D#install-openssl)

### Submodules

For authorization token verification and token content extraction this library uses the Delphi JOSE JWT library. Thank you Paolo Rossi for your great library!
